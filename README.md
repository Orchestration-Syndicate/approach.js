# Approach.js

The JavaScript implementation of Approach.

## TypeScript Support

Since the quite a few of types in Approach are based on Generator functions, TypeScript support is limited
for those parts of the codebase. However, TypeScript is implemented to the best of it's ability for
the type safety and code completion benefits.

## Running
