# Approach.js

The JavaScript implementation of Approach.

## TypeScript Support

Since the quite a few of types in Approach are based on Generator functions, TypeScript support is limited
for those parts of the codebase. However, TypeScript is implemented to the best of it's ability for
the type safety and code completion benefits.

## Running

It is recommended that you use `bun.js` to run the code, however, anything above Node.js 14 should work.

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the tests: `npm run index.js`

## Tests

Tests are written using the bun testing frameword. To run the tests, run `bun test`.
